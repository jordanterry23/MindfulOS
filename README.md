When I would go to bed, sometimes I would have trouble sleeping because of the thoughts racing through my head. I actually would visualize putting these thoughts into little boxes so that I could give myself a feeling of relief. It was a way to acknowledge the thoughts I was having but tell myself that it was okay, and I think about it and process it in the morning. After playing with that idea for a while, and trying to think of different iterations and ways to make it work, I decided to use this as an idea to get to know Godot.

I created all of the visual assets and animations and tried to limit myself to simple, minimalist shapes and designs. I wanted to recreate the views of older operating systems (Windows 98-ish) and create a simple drag-and-drop game to sort things into tiny boxes. After all, dragging and dropping should be easy... right?

It took me some time and a lot of headaches. Why? Because there are many ways to accomplish the same task. Once again I found myself wondering which way was The Correct Way â„¢  to accomplish it. I had to remind myself that for this project, there is no correct way, just one of the many ways I can get it done. And so... I did.

I had also been experiencing some troubling times as of late, so making this project was cathartic to me. This project allowed me to get the things I was thinking or feeling (whether accurate, based in reality, or just a feeling with no actual basis) off my chest. It was okay to feel upset, and it was okay to put these thoughts away. It was okay to re-construct these thoughts more positively.

This being the case, this is another project that I can say is complete, and something I can show that I made. A "Ghost of Done" if you will. 

So if you are reading this, thank you for checking this out, and I will be working on a couple of more positive projects in the future.

Thank you, and have a wonderful day.
